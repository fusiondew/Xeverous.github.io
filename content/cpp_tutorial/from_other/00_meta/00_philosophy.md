## approach to features

C++ is a language from experts for experts. A lot of "features" exist simply because it was considered bad to forbid them just because they could be misused. Major examples of this are inheritance and operator overloading.

Back in time, IT industry had not as much experience as today so it was decided it would be better not to push artificial constraints. While sticking to well-established 1 state parent class + interfaces pattern is highly recommended we have seen some amazing projects that abused C++ features to the extreme (especially templates).

A good example of absolute abuse of operator overloading is Boost Spirit library. TODO wikipedia link

## time effects

C++ has 40 years of history which makes it the oldest widely-used programming language that provides high-level abstractions. There are older languages but none of them are used as much as C++ and they do not get

## maintenance process

C++ is not owned by anyone nor by any company. Language is maintained by ISO SC22 WG21 committee which since 2011 aims to issue new international standard every 3 years. The committee consists of experts from various software and hardware companies including the most recognized ones (Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, Qt, nVidia and more). There is no entry barrier to the inside and obviously more people are wanted.

Other programming language committees:

- WG1 - PLIP (no longer active)
- WG2 - Pascal (no longer active)
- WG3 - APL (no longer active)
- WG4 - COBOL
- WG5 - Fortran
- WG6 - Algol (no longer active)
- WG7 - PL/I (no longer active)
- WG8 - Basic (no longer active)
- WG9 - Ada
- WG13 - Modula-2 (no longer active)
- WG14 - C
- WG17 - Prolog

It is worth nothing as not so many languages have open process of creation. Many languages that are owned by big corporations (eg C# - Microsoft, Swift - Apple, Java - Oracle) also feature open process but ultimately they are made for the benefit of their company.

Other language featuring similar process which recently gained a lot of popularity (thanks to Google investment) is Python. Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation. It is also an open, independent process but not as official as through ISO.

Most of the users of any language do not care much about its maintenance process but there are some niches like military organizations which prefer not to rely on a technology owned by a foreign country company.
