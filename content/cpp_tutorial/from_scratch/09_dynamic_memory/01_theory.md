For static duration, thread duration and automatic duration variables, the size of the allocation must be a compile time constant. Compiler must know at compile time what's the size of the object to correctly handle stack memory. This is why arrays must have a compile-time size.

Even if it's known how much memory is needed, large arrays such as `int[1000000]` may crash. Automatic/static allocation is fast and generally very efficient but the stack is limited - 1 to 8 MB on most dektop systems and significantly less on most of other hardware. Stack size is limited by the processor, not by the RAM.

When we want arrays of runtime-dependent size or large blocks of memory there is no other choice than dynamic allocation.

**Dynamic memory allocation** allows few very unique things:
- access to the heap memory (basically the entire RAM)
- ability to allocate memory blocks of any length
- ability to allocate and deallocate at any time

**Dynamically allocated memory is always a one, continuous block.**

Dynamic memory allocation is not a simple topic and has been a very important thing across multiple levels of programming (OS stuff, language/library design, application performance and more). I will now go through all abstractions over dynamic memory allocation from the past to the present and possible future additions.

## dynamic memory in C

Very basic abstraction, but probably the easiest to understand.

There are 2 core functions:

```c
#include <stdlib.h> // in C++ also <cstlib>, functions inside namespace std

void* malloc(size_t size); // memory allocation (size in bytes)
void free(void* ptr);      // memory deallocation
```

`malloc()` allocates (reserves for your program) `size` bytes of free memory and returns an untyped pointer to the first cell. **Allocated memory has no predefined state or type.** In C, dynamic allocation goes beyond type system.

Because there is a requirement to always allocate 1 continuous block, allocation may fail even if there is enough free memory in the system - the sum of free regions may be larger than the asked for but there might not exist a block that is sufficiently large - in such case null pointer is returned.

When the memory is no longer needed, the pointer received from `malloc()` should be passed to `free()` so that the operating system can reclaim that block and reuse it for itself or other programs that ask for dynamic memory. After freeing, the pointer received from allocation is dangling and accessing any memory within that block is undefined behaviour.

TODO def block

If the program allocates memory but does not free it it's a **memory leak**. If a program does not stop growing it's memory consumption at some point no more memory will be available in the system - usually causing itself (and other programs) to slowdown significantly (disk memory is used instead) or crash.

Dynamically allocated memory is not initialized. It's contents are unknown.

### example

Allocate N integers and then release memory.

```c++
int n = /* something run-time dependent */;

void* const ptr = std::malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // allocate memory for n integers

if (ptr == nullptr)
{
    std::cout << "allocation failed\n";
}
else
{
    std::cout << "allocation succeeded";

    int* p = static_cast<int*>(ptr);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        // use p[i] - note that contents are not initialized
    }

    std::free(p);
}
```

TODO more examples, give something runnable

### additional allocation functions

```c
void* aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);
void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
void* realloc(void* ptr, size_t new_size);
```

`aligned_alloc()` works similar to `malloc()` with the difference that the allocated memory is aligned (it's address is a multiple of `alignment`). Allowed alignment values are system-dependent (POSIX allows `sizeof(void*)` multiplied by powers of 2). This is useful for allocations aiming to use cache more effectively.

`calloc()` works similar to `malloc()` but it zero-initializes the allocated memory. Weird thing is that `malloc()` takes one argument (size in bytes) but `calloc()` takes 2 arguments (number of elements, size in bytes of each element).

`realloc()` reallocates memory to a larger/smaller block. Useful when the program wants to increase the capacity or free some memory but not all of it.

## What is inside `malloc()`

Magic. More precisely, internal operating system implementation of the memory allocation. 

The OS owns all memory - it has no access checks and can access all data freely (no access violations!). OS kernel can dereference any pointer - there is nothing beneath that would prevent it from doing so.

To safely run programs requiring various amount of memory, each program has to ask for it. When a program calls system's memory allocation functions, system searches it's heap index (called *free list*) for a block that could be assigned. Various allocation algorithms exist with different trade-offs - some take more time to process but result in smaller memory fragmentation (amount of very small free blocks), some store more metadata (amount of free blocks, their size, preference, cached regions, etc) which of course requires some memory for the allocation itself. This is why allocating X memory takes actually more than X - the system has to store information about allocations.

The algorithm used to implement memory allocation has a huge impact on system performance - allocation functions can be called several thousands each second!

An example memory allocation implementation is available as [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net). It's used by Android and FreeBSD.

## problems with C dynamic allocation functions

- `malloc()` returns `void*` - **no type safety**.
- It's easy to miscalculate required memory (it's in bytes) - most common mistake is forgetting to multiply by the size of the type.
- It's very easy to allocate and then forget to free which results is memory leaks.
- If the pointer given by `malloc()` is lost (by overwriting it or going out of scope), it can no longer be passed to `free()` and therefore the program has a memory leak.
- Freed memory can no longer be accessed - calling `free()` twice with the same pointer is undefined behaviour.
- Freed memory can no longer be accessed - pointers passed to `free()` become dangling pointers.

Generally, from C++ point of view dynamic memory allocation in C is very bug-prone and has no type safety.

## C++ dynamic memory allocation abstractions

C++ offers much more advanced abstractions to avoid these problems. Dynamic memory is a quite large topic and as the tutorial goes further more abstractions will be presented.

As you progress the tutorial, more higher-level abstractions will be presented.

Abstractions (lowest ones first):

- `malloc()`, `free()` and related functions (current lesson)
- new/delete (next lesson)
- allocators
- containers, *smart pointers*
