## Site FAQ

### Site content

#### Why tutorials are not build incrementally over consecutive C++ standards?

This not a good idea. If you play any online game - do you learn it how it is at given moment or read patch notes for every update since the beginning? It's good to know what things have been introduced in what order, but it doesn't do well in terms of learning. A lot of features can be mixed together, so the order of presentation matters, not the chronological order of their introduction.

It's better to study a complete feature in one go than to jump back to it periodically because there was a language update. It makes searching hard (unstructured lessons) and requires jumping between features when learning which may be confusing and counter-productive. Plus you are not going to remember when everything was introduced anyway.

However, newer features are explicitly marked and most chapters about certain features do go upfront from the start to the latest changes.

### Site creation

#### What was the motivation to create the site?

Initially, I wanted to contribute to learncpp.com (which is regarded as one of the best sites for learning C++), but [Alex said](http://www.learncpp.com/site-news/find-something-wrong/comment-page-2/#comment-310505) it's not currently possible and "technology is not there yet".

There are many other sites, but since they are more blog-oriented for periodic news and posts, I disregarded them and planned to build own guide based on plain markdown repository. I wanted a structured, step-by-step guide, not date ordered blog posts.

Soon then, I realized GitHub has opened GitHub Pages and allowed for free static website hosting also offering integrated Jekyll. That's much better than reading pure markdown.

Other consequences

- I will learn one of countless web frameworks
- I will consolidate my skills and knowledge (and even use the site myself)
- the site is a good portfolio for both of us (creators)

#### What technologies are used for this website?

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static site generator using Ruby language and Liquid template engine
- (obviously) HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript
- Bootstrap 4.0.0
- theme is heavily modified version of [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc)

[Site repository](https://github.com/Xeverous/Xeverous.github.io)

#### Who is behind the site?

So far all the content is written by me ([/u/Xeverous](https://www.reddit.com/user/Xeverous/) on reddit, [Xeverous](https://github.com/Xeverous) on GitHub) and all the frontend is done by <a style="font-weight: 300 !important;" href="mailto:miks.szymon@gmail.com">Szymon Miks</a>.
