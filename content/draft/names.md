legend:

- **very strong** - used practically always
- **strong** - used most of the time
- **weak** - used when there is no better alternative (usually there is one)

## loops

- (very strong) `i`, `j`, `k` and so on - probably originated from `i` as a shortcut for *iteration* - this convention applies to very many programming languages
- (strong) `it` - for loops and algorithms using iterators

## templates - alias names

- (very strong) `T`, `U`, `V` and so on - similarly to loops, likely originated from `T` as a shortcut for *type* or *template
- (very strong) `Iterator`, `UnaryPredicate`, `TriviallyCopyable` - concept names for types that are expected to satisfy certain requirements (since C++20 actual language feature, no longer a convention)

## other

`lhs`, `rhs` (left/right hand side) - used for operator overloading and comparisons
